# ft_printf_tester

Just a bad tester, better than everyone always using the same tests.
New branch doesn't have much but the subject is pretty short...

How to use the tester:

-copy your libftprintf.a in the test directory

-run tpftester.sh (look at the code for options)

-in case of error, add 100 to error_number and look at that line in the C source (such UI such wow)
