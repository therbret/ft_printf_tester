# ft_printf_tester

How to use:

-copy your libftprintf.a in the test directory

-run the .sh script of your choosing (to test leaks or use fsanitize)

-in case of error, add 100 to error_number and look at that line in the C source

-sorry the script sucks, this was just a tool to work on my printf
